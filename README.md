# Face-Recognition
Code for face recognition using three modules to collect face data, train the machine using the data and the using the machine to recognise faces.

In the first phase using the facedata.py we collect the data in the form of gray images and store it in a folder named "dataset".

In the second phase we create a YML file to train the data that was collected.

In the third phase we use the trained data and recognise faces which can be further integrated with other developments.
